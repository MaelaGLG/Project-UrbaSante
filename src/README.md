# Scripts Directory
This folder contains various scripts used in the project. These scripts perform different tasks, including data processing, creation of indicators, formatting and the script of the R Shiny App.

# Structure and description
This project is organized into three main folders, each serving a specific role in the data processing pipeline. Below is a breakdown of each folderâ€™s purpose:

# 1- Row --> Intermediate

# 2- Intermediate --> Formatted

# 3- Formatted --> Final

# How to Use:
You can either start from the raw data and follow all the steps or start from the already formatted data. 

# Steps when starting from the raw data
1. Start with the raw data: Ensure that you have the different raw datasets ready in the format expected by the scripts in the 1- Row --> Intermediate folder.

2. Process the raw data: Run the scripts in the 1- Row --> Intermediate folder to create the indicators.

3. Format the indicators: After generating the indicators, use the scripts in the 2- Intermediate --> Formatted folder to clean and format them.

4. Final processing: Run the scripts in the 3- Formatted --> Final folder to merge all the formatted data and produce the final dataset.
