# Procedure to Build Indicators

## Explanations

Our project includes three satellite indicators across two determinants:
- Determinant 4: "Impermeable Surface" / "Forest Cover"
- Determinant 5: "Radiance"

The same script is used for each of these indicators, and the procedure to build them is detailed below.

## Procedure to Build Each Indicator Separately

1. **Download the data** associated with the specific indicator.
2. Open the **"satellite master file"** script and update all paths manually based on the repository you're working in.
3. Open the **"satellite indicator"** script and run it to build the indicator.
   
Repeat these steps for each of the three indicators.
